# Scope List of the FTax Project (as of Feb 10, 2022)
After a month of research, combined with initial team meetings and architecture implementation, there is a need to step back and reevaluate.
We are experiencing a scope creep and as we dive deeper into the project, we realize that the project is a lot more work than anticipated. There is a need to have detailed 
discussion and manage project expectations. The potential of this product is still sound but the project is shaping up to be full service product. Such a service implementation 
needs a development team working full-time while having the formal origanized structure that implements industry standart software development practices.

Below is a list of abstracted tasks necessary to see the project to fruition. Note that, like any project, the list is not final in any means and is subject to change.
